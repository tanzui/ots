# Parallel scan

In scenarios where you are not concerned with the order of the query results, you can use parallel scan to obtain query results in parallel.

## Background information

The Search operation of search indexes provides a full set of query and analysis capabilities such as sorting and aggregation to return query results in a specified order.

However, in some cases you may be more concerned with the query speed than with the order of the results, such as when you integrate Tablestore with the cluster computing environment Spark or Presto or when you query a specified group of objects. To address these needs, Tablestore provides the ParallelScan operation for search index.

**Note:** SDKs 5.6.0 and later support the parallel scan feature.

Compared with the Search operation, the ParallelScan operation supports all query features but does not provide analysis capabilities such as sorting and aggregation. This way, the query speed is improved by more than five times. You can call the ParallelScan operation to export hundreds of millions of data records within a minute. This capability to export data can be horizontally expanded without limits.

The maximum number of rows to return by sending a single parallel scan request is greater than that of a Search request. A single Search request can query up to 100 rows, whereas a single parallel scan request can query up to 2,000 rows. The parallel scan feature allows you to use multiple threads to initiate requests, which accelerates data exports.

## Scenarios

-   Use the Search operation if you want to sort or aggregate query results or if the query request is sent from an end user.
-   Use the ParallelScan operation if you do not need to sort query results and want to obtain all matched results quickly or if the data is queried by a computing environment such as Spark or Presto.

## Features

Compared with the Search operation, the ParallelScan operation has the following features:

-   Stable results

    Parallel scan tasks are subject to the data status. In a session, the result set of the scanned data is determined by the data status when the first request is initiated. If data is inserted or modified after the first request is sent, the result set is not affected.

-   Sessions

    ParallelScan-related operations use sessions. The session ID can be used to determine the result set of scanned data in the following process:

    1.  Use the ComputeSplits operation to query the maximum number of concurrent threads and the current session ID.
    2.  Initiate multiple concurrent parallel scan requests to read data. You must specify the current session ID and the concurrency ID in these requests.
    In scenarios where session IDs are difficult to obtain, you can also call ParallelScan to initiate a request without specifying a session ID. However, if you send a request without a session ID, the obtained result set may contain duplicate data.

    Tablestore returns the OTSSessionExpired error code when network exceptions, thread exceptions, dynamic modifications on schema, or index switchover occurs during the parallel scan process and the data scan stops. In this case, you must initiate another parallel scan task to scan data again.

-   Maximum number of concurrent threads

    The maximum number of concurrent threads supported by parallel scan is determined by the returned value of ComputeSplits. The larger the volume of data is, the more supported concurrent threads are.

    A single request is specified by one query statement. For example, if you use the Search operation to query results where the value of city is Hangzhou, all data that matches this condition is returned in the result. However, if you use the ParallelScan operation and the number of concurrent threads is 2, each query returns half of the results. The complete result set consists of the two concurrent result sets.

-   Rows to return for each request

    The default value of limit is 2000. The maximum value of limit is 5000. If you set the value of limit to greater than 5000, the performance remains unchanged.

-   Performance

    The query speed of a single parallel scan request is five times higher than that of a single Search request. If you increase the number of concurrent threads when you use parallel scan, the query speed increases linearly. For example, eight concurrent parallel scan threads can improve the query speed by four times.

-   Cost

    Parallel scan requests consume fewer resources and are offered at a lower price. If you need to export large amounts of data, we recommend that you use the ParallelScan operation.

-   Columns to return

    Only indexed columns can be queried in search indexes. The ReturnType parameter can be set to RETURN\_ALL\_INDEX or RETURN\_SPECIFIED, but cannot be set to RETURN\_ALL.

    In addition, arrays, geographical locations, and nested fields cannot be returned. If you want to query data of these types, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ticket/createInd) or contact Tablestore technical support by using DingTalk.

-   Limits

    The maximum number of concurrent parallel scan tasks is 10. This limit will be adjusted to meet your requirements in the future. Concurrent tasks that have the same session ID and the same ScanQuery parameter value are considered as one task. A parallel scan task starts when the parallel scan request is sent for the first time, and ends when all data is scanned or the token expires.


## API operations

Concurrent data export is implemented by using the following API operations:

-   ComputeSplits: You can call this operation to query the maximum number of concurrent tasks for a single ParallelScan request.
-   ParallelScan: You can call this operation to export data.

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|tableName|The name of the table.|
|indexName|The name of the search index.|
|scanQuery|query|The query statement for the search index. The operation supports exact query, fuzzy query, query by range, query by geographical location, and nested query, which is similar to those of the Search operation.|
|limit|The maximum number of rows that can be returned at a time.|
|maxParallel|The maximum number of concurrent threads. The maximum number of concurrent threads varies based on the data volume. The larger the volume of data is, the more concurrent threads are supported. You can use the ComputeSplits operation to query the maximum number of concurrent requests.|
|currentParallelId|The ID of the concurrent requests. Valid values: \[0, Value of maxParallel\)|
|token|The token used for pagination. The result of the parallel scan request contains the token for the next page. You can use the token to query data for the following page.|
|aliveTime|The validity period of the current parallel scan task. It is also the validity period of the token. We recommend that you use the default value. If the next request is not initiated within the validity period, more data cannot be queried. The validity period of the token is refreshed each time you send a request.|
|columnsToGet|You can use parallel scan to query only indexed columns in search indexes. You must set store to true when you create a search index. In addition, parallel scan cannot be used to query ARRAY, GEOPOINT, and NEST columns.|
|sessionId|The session ID of the parallel scan task. You can call the ComputeSplits operation to create a session and query the maximum number of concurrent requests that is supported by the task.|

## Examples

The following code provides examples on how to scan data by sending a single request or by using multiple threads at a time:

-   Scan data by sending a single request

    When you use parallel scan, the code for a single request is simpler than that for a request that uses multithreading. The currentParallelId and maxParallel parameters are not required for a single request.
