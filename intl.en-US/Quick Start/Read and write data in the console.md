## Query data

In the Tablestore console, you can query data in a single row \(GetRow\) or query data within a specified range \(RangeQuery\).

To query data in a single row, perform the following operations:

1.  Log on to the [Tablestore console](https://otsnext.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  On the Overview page, click the name of the requested instance or click **Manage Instance** in the Actions column corresponding to the instance.

3.  In the Tables section of the Instance Details tab, click the name of the requested table, and click the Data Editor tab. You can also click **Data Editor** in the Actions column corresponding to the table.

4.  On the Data Editor tab, click **Search**.

5.  Set filter conditions.

    1.  Set Modes to **GetRow**.

        ![fig_tablestore_006](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9477925951/p96271.png)

    2.  By default, all columns are returned. To return a specific attribute column, turn off **All Columns**, and then enter the specified attribute columns. Separate the attribute columns with commas\(,\).

        **Note:** You can specify a maximum of 20 attribute columns in the console. This limit does not apply to Tablestore SDK.

    3.  Set **Primary Key Columns**.

        The integrity and accuracy of the primary key value affect the query results.

    4.  Set **Max Versions** to specify the maximum number of versions to return.

        **Note:** You can specify a maximum of 20 attribute columns in the console. This limit does not apply to Tablestore SDK.

6.  Click **OK**.

    Data that meets the filter conditions is displayed on the Data Editor tab.


To perform range query, perform the following steps:

1.  Log on to the [Tablestore console](https://otsnext.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  On the Overview page, click the name of the requested instance or click **Manage Instance** in the Actions column corresponding to the instance.

3.  In the Tables section of the Instance Details tab, click the name of the requested table, and click the Data Editor tab. You can also click **Data Editor** in the Actions column corresponding to the table.

4.  On the Data Editor tab, click **Search**.

5.  Set filter conditions.

    1.  Set Modes to **Range Search**.

        ![fig_tablestore_007](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9477925951/p96285.png)

    2.  By default, all columns are returned. To return a specific attribute column, turn off **All Columns**, and then enter the specified attribute columns. Separate the attribute columns with commas\(,\).

        **Note:** You can specify a maximum of 20 attribute columns in the console. This limit does not apply to Tablestore SDK.

    3.  Set Start Primary Key Column and End Primary Key Column.

        You can set Start Primary Key Column to **Min Value** or **Custom** and End Primary Key Column to **Max Value** or **Custom**. If you select **Custom**, enter a custom value.

        **Note:**

        -   The value in the first primary key column takes priority when the range query mode is used. When the minimum and maximum values for the first primary key column are the same, the system uses the value in the second primary key column to perform the query. The query rules for the subsequent primary keys are the same as those for the first two primary keys.
        -   The Custom range is a left-open and right-closed interval.
    4.  Set **Max Versions** to specify the maximum number of versions to return.

        **Note:** You can specify a maximum of 20 attribute columns in the console. This limit does not apply to Tablestore SDK.

    5.  Set Sequence to **Forward Search** or **Backward Search**.

6.  Click **OK**.

    Data that meets the filter conditions is displayed based on the specified order on the Data Editor tab.
